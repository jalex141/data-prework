The company wants to analyze the data provided by the sensor to decide if they should change the cooling system for a better one. As changing the cooling system is expensive and you are an excellent data analyst, you can't make a decision without basis.\n\n## Tools\nYou don't necessarily need to use all the tools. Maybe you opt to use some of them or completely different ones, they are given to help you shape the exercise. Programming exercises can be solved in many different ways.\n1.
